  "title": "\"Common Questions on El Salvador: Death Squads and Abductions in 1986-1988\"",
  "date": "June 1979",
  "description": "The document discusses the issue of death squads in El Salvador, a practice that has been ongoing since the late 1970s and early 1980s. These abductions and killings by heavily armed men in civilian dress have been a longstanding problem, with most unclaimed actions not being attributed to self-proclaimed death squads. The document also mentions the phenomenon of anonymous abductions, where Salvadoran citizens were forcibly taken from their homes at night and disappeared in government detention centers. Despite these claims, U.S. and Salvadoran officials have never acknowledged a clear connection between military or police practices and the unexplained appearance of hundreds of Salvadoran citizens in government detention centers. The document highlights the complexity of this issue and the challenges faced by human rights monitors, the press, and the public in understanding and addressing it.",
